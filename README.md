# Cryptography-Ciphers
13 classic cryptography ciphers with encrypt and decrypt functions made in C.

Run the a.exe file to open the menu, and then follow the instructions. The file is to be run in a CLI.

If that doesn't work, compile the following with any C compiler (I used gcc) - 
```
main.c caesar.c atbash.c affine.c vigenere.c gronsfeld.c beaufort.c autokey.c runningkey.c hill.c railfence.c route.c myszkowiski.c
```
and run the output executable.
